-This project was made using Firebase.

-Data is fetched from Firebase database with async - await structure and  displayed.

For REACT ROUTER , that is a very good example

NOTE: SINCE THE FIREBASE DATABASE WAS CREATED AS A TEST PROJECT, THE 30-DAY TEST PERIOD HAS EXPIRED AND THE DATA MAY NOT BE COMING WHEN YOU CHECK THE LIVE LINK. PLEASE CHECK THE GIFS.
